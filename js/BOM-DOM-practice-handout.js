//TODO: When the #changeBoxSize button is clicked the box should double in size from what it was!

//TODO: I have two CSS classes - toggleClass1 and toggleClass1 - that are currently unused. When the #toggleClass button is clicked, program a bit of JavaScript to toggle between those classes to see the background-color switch back and forth with each click. Bonus: Write your callback function in a variable and use it instead!

//TODO: In the #boxInfo element, when the BOX is hovered over the HEIGHT and WIDTH of the box would appear in that HTML area [div]

//TODO: When the user types in to our #input and then clicks #inputBtn, what they typed into the box should replace what was inside of the span #userName with the input's contents

//TODO: Refactor the above work - after 5 seconds have passed from the user clicking #inputBtn and seeing #userName change, change the entire div of #helloUser to say "Let me know if you want to play a game. ."


// Below are examples of how to update add, or edit HTML elements

// title.style.margin = 'auto';
// title.style.margin = '50px';
title.style.color = 'crimson';
title.style.fontSize = '60px';
